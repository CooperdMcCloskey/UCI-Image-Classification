# Wildlife Camera Image Classification UCI Nature

This is a project done as a UCI Nature intern to help remove false triggers from wildlife camera data and hopefully classify the different species found.

Further documentation, a protocol to use this work, and a guide for maintainance will hopefully become available as the project progresses
